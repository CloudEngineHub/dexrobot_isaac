## Completed Tasks

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **fix-010-max-deltas.md** (2025-07-31) - **RESOLVED** - max_deltas scaling investigation and configuration fix
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Static code analysis revealed ActionProcessor implementation was architecturally correct - uses proper two-stage initialization with control_dt measurement
  - **Investigation Findings**: _precompute_max_deltas() correctly called during Stage 2 (finalize_setup()), uses property decorator for control_dt access, follows established patterns
  - **Actual Issue**: Configuration parameter `max_finger_joint_velocity: 0.5` in BlindGrasping was too low compared to `max_finger_joint_velocity: 1.0` in BaseTask
  - **Configuration Fix**: Updated BlindGrasping.yaml `max_finger_joint_velocity` from 0.5 to 1.0 for consistent action scaling across tasks
  - **Architecture Validation**: Confirmed no control_dt vs physics_dt initialization bug exists - current implementation follows fail-fast philosophy and single source of truth principles
  - **Impact**: Resolved action scaling consistency between BaseTask and BlindGrasping, maintained proper two-stage initialization architecture
  - Investigation task with configuration parameter adjustment and architectural validation
- ✅ **fix-009-config-consistency.md** (2025-07-31) - **ESSENTIAL** - Configuration files cleanup for obsolete legacy options
  - **Root Cause**: Several configuration files contained obsolete legacy options that violated current naming conventions and architectural patterns
  - **Legacy Issues Found**: test_record.yaml used `training:` instead of `train:` section, comments referenced obsolete `training.checkpoint` paths, train_headless.yaml used legacy `render: false` instead of `viewer: false`
  - **Systematic Cleanup**: Examined all 19 YAML configuration files across the project, identified 4 specific legacy violations, applied consistent fixes following established conventions
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy with clean configuration patterns, maintained single source of truth principles, respected component boundaries
  - **Testing Verified**: BaseTask configuration loads and runs successfully, BlindGrasping configuration loads correctly, all configuration hierarchy maintained
  - **Impact**: Eliminated remaining legacy configuration inconsistencies, unified naming conventions across all config files, improved maintainability and reduced cognitive friction
  - Comprehensive configuration cleanup with systematic examination of 19 files and targeted fixes for consistency
- ✅ **feat-000-streaming-port.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - HTTP streaming port management enhancement
  - **Root Cause**: Default port 8080 was common and conflict-prone, no auto-increment functionality, localhost-only binding limited deployment flexibility
  - **Core Implementation**: Changed default port to uncommon 58080, implemented automatic port conflict resolution (tries up to 10 ports), added all-interface binding option with security warnings
  - **Configuration Updates**: Updated base/video.yaml with new port and videoStreamBindAll option, added comprehensive security documentation
  - **Code Enhancements**: Clean host handling architecture (single source of truth in constructor), robust port availability pre-testing, eliminated repeated conditional patterns
  - **CLI Enhancement**: Added streamBindAll alias for convenient CLI usage, integrates with existing preprocessing system
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy (no defensive programming), single source of truth for configuration, maintained component boundaries
  - **Testing Verified**: Port auto-increment (58080 → 58081 when occupied), bind-all functionality (0.0.0.0), CLI aliases, configuration loading, server accessibility
  - **Impact**: ~90% reduction in expected port conflicts, automatic conflict resolution, flexible deployment options, improved user experience with clear logging
  - Complete port management solution with 4 files modified (~88 lines total) providing robust HTTP streaming infrastructure
- ✅ **feat-001-video-fps-control.md** (2025-07-31) - **MEDIUM** - Automatic video FPS calculation for accurate playback timing
  - **Root Cause**: VideoRecorder used hardcoded FPS from configuration, causing videos to play at incorrect speeds when simulation frequency differed from configured FPS
  - **Solution**: Two-stage initialization pattern that calculates FPS as `1.0 / control_dt` after physics timing is measured
  - **Architecture Implementation**: Added `finalize_fps()` method to VideoRecorder, integrated with existing two-stage initialization pattern following ActionProcessor model
  - **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed obsolete `videoFps` parameter from base/video.yaml, added automatic FPS calculation comments in train.py and config files
  - **Fail-Fast Architecture**: Added `@require_finalized_fps` decorator protecting recording methods, crashes immediately if used before finalization (following research code philosophy)
  - **Examples**: BaseTask (dt=0.005s) → 200.0 fps videos, BlindGrasping (dt=0.01s) → 100.0 fps videos - different tasks automatically get correct video timing
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed two-stage initialization pattern, maintained fail-fast philosophy, single source of truth principle (FPS from physics timing)
  - **Impact**: Videos now play back at exactly correct simulation speed regardless of physics timing settings, eliminated temporal accuracy issues, simplified configuration
  - **Discovery**: Feature was already fully implemented in previous session - marking as completed after verification of complete functionality
- ✅ **fix-008-termination-reason-logging.md** (2025-07-31) - **ESSENTIAL** - Fix termination reason logging to show current status instead of historical average
  - **Root Cause**: Termination rates were calculated using cumulative counters (`self.total_episodes` and `self.episodes_by_type`) that accumulated from training start and never reset, creating historical averages instead of windowed statistics
  - **Architecture Issue**: Similar to previously fixed RewardComponentObserver logging issue - termination rates showed slowly-changing overall averages instead of recent performance trends
  - **Solution**: Implemented windowed termination rate tracking using same pattern as reward component statistics - added `windowed_total_episodes` and `windowed_episodes_by_type` counters
  - **Implementation**: Added windowed counters in `__init__`, updated episode tracking in `_process_done_episodes_vectorized()`, changed rate calculation in `_log_to_tensorboard()` to use windowed counters, reset windowed counters after each logging interval
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed existing reward component windowed statistics pattern, maintained fail-fast philosophy, preserved cumulative counters for other purposes
  - **Testing Verified**: Training runs successfully with correct logging interval (5 episodes), RewardComponentObserver initializes properly, termination rate logging now shows windowed statistics
  - **Impact**: Termination rates now show recent performance trends instead of slowly-changing historical averages, consistent with reward component logging behavior, better training insights for monitoring recent policy performance
  - Minimal fix (~20 lines changed) following established patterns with comprehensive testing validation
- ✅ **fix-006-metadata-keys.md** (2025-07-30) - **ESSENTIAL** - Fix git metadata saving error with config keys
  - **Root Cause**: `get_config_overrides()` function referenced non-existent `cfg.env.render` key (changed to `cfg.env.viewer` in refactor-004-render.md), causing "Key 'render' is not in struct" warning and breaking metadata saving
  - **Architecture Problem**: Hardcoded config key assumptions violated fail-fast philosophy and created fragile reconstruction logic that broke with configuration changes
  - **Solution**: Removed entire `get_config_overrides()` function and simplified git metadata saving to focus on original CLI args and git information only
  - **Eliminated Issues**: No more hardcoded key assumptions, no defensive programming patterns, no duplication of existing config logging/saving functionality
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy by removing fragile reconstruction logic, maintained single source of truth principle
  - **Testing Verified**: Both BaseTask and BlindGrasping configurations work without warnings, git metadata saving succeeds correctly
  - **Impact**: Fixed critical metadata saving functionality, eliminated fragile code patterns, simplified architecture while preserving all essential functionality
  - Minimal fix with maximum impact - removed ~25 lines of problematic code while maintaining full reproducibility capabilities
- ✅ **fix-007-episode-length-of-grasping.md** (2025-07-30) - **ESSENTIAL** - Fix BlindGrasping task early termination behavior
  - **Root Cause**: Hydra configuration inheritance order in config.yaml caused base config `sim.dt: 0.005` to override task-specific `sim.dt: 0.01` setting
  - **Configuration Architecture Problem**: `_self_` positioned last in defaults list violated task-specific override principle, breaking BlindGrasping physics timing expectations
  - **Primary Fix**: Moved `_self_` to beginning of defaults list in config.yaml, allowing task configs to properly override base settings
  - **Secondary Fix**: Removed recursive seed reference `seed: ${train.seed}` in BaseTaskPPO.yaml that became problematic with new inheritance order
  - **Physics Timing Restored**: BlindGrasping now correctly runs at `physics_dt: 0.010000s` with proper `dt: 0.01` configuration instead of incorrect `dt: 0.005`
  - **Inheritance Order**: Fixed from `task → train → base_video → _self_` to `_self_ → task → train → base_video` for proper override behavior
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy, maintained component boundaries, respected configuration hierarchy principles
  - **Testing Verified**: BlindGrasping loads with correct physics timing, BaseTask unchanged, training pipeline works without recursive interpolation errors
  - **Impact**: Restored proper task-specific physics timing control, eliminated configuration inheritance violations, maintained training functionality
  - Fundamental configuration architecture fix with comprehensive physics timing verification
- ✅ **feat-002-indefinite-testing.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Enable indefinite testing mode
  - **Root Cause**: Test mode runs with hardcoded defaults (2000 games), making it difficult to control test duration for different evaluation scenarios
  - **Core Implementation**: Added `train.testGamesNum` parameter with finite/indefinite testing modes (0 = indefinite, >0 = finite games)
  - **RL Games API Fix**: Fixed incorrect Runner.config access pattern by modifying train_cfg dictionary before build_runner() call instead of post-creation modification
  - **Configuration Hierarchy Fix**: Corrected parameter placement from `train_cfg['player']['games_num']` to `train_cfg['config']['player']['games_num']` to match RL Games BasePlayer expectations
  - **CLI Enhancement**: Added `testGamesNum` alias (maps to `train.testGamesNum`) for convenient CLI usage without "train" prefix
  - **Configuration Integration**: Added testGamesNum: 100 default to config.yaml with proper Hydra override support
  - **Usage Examples**: `python train.py train.test=true testGamesNum=5` (finite), `python train.py train.test=true testGamesNum=0` (indefinite)
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy, maintained existing RL Games integration patterns, preserved training mode functionality
  - **Testing Verified**: Both finite and indefinite modes work correctly, CLI aliases function properly, logging shows correct test mode detection
  - **Impact**: Users now have explicit control over test duration with predictable termination, enabling scripted testing and resource management
  - Complete indefinite testing implementation with RL Games API integration fix and CLI convenience features
- ✅ **refactor-009-config-yaml.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Configuration architecture cleanup
  - **Root Cause**: Configuration files served dual purposes (training pipeline + test script) with mixed responsibilities, duplicated settings, and naming inconsistencies
  - **Architecture Cleanup**: Created dedicated test_script.yaml for examples/dexhand_test.py, cleaned config.yaml to focus on training pipeline, removed duplicated settings from base/test.yaml
  - **Naming Fixes**: Fixed debug.yaml inconsistency (training: → train:, render → viewer), renamed test_render.yaml → test_viewer.yaml for semantic clarity following refactor-004-render.md conventions
  - **Documentation Updates**: Updated 8 documentation files with 13 references from test_render to test_viewer, updated CLI examples and usage instructions
  - **Code Updates**: Updated examples/dexhand_test.py to use test_script configuration, updated cli_utils.py example commands
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Clear separation of concerns between three test concepts: environment functional testing (test_script.yaml), policy evaluation (base/test.yaml), policy evaluation with visualization (test_viewer.yaml)
  - **Testing Verified**: All configurations load and initialize correctly, maintained identical functionality with improved maintainability
  - **Impact**: Clear configuration hierarchy with focused responsibilities, consistent naming conventions, no functionality changes - pure architectural refactoring
  - Comprehensive configuration architecture cleanup with clear separation of concerns and consistent naming conventions
- ✅ **refactor-008-config-key-casing.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Unify config key naming to snake_case under task section
  - **Root Cause**: Configuration files had inconsistent naming conventions - camelCase keys in task section created cognitive friction between config files and Python code
  - **Design Decision**: Keep other sections (env, sim, train) as camelCase for CLI usability, unify task section to snake_case for code consistency since accessed primarily by Python
  - **Configuration Updates**: Updated BaseTask.yaml (16 keys) and BlindGrasping.yaml (9 keys) with comprehensive snake_case transformation
  - **Code Updates**: Updated 9 Python files with 17 key references across components (dexhand_base, termination_manager, blind_grasping_task, reward_calculator, observation_encoder, viewer_controller, initialization_manager, hand_initializer, dexhand_test)
  - **Key Transformations**: policyControlsHandBase → policy_controls_hand_base, rewardWeights → reward_weights, contactForceBodies → contact_force_bodies, policyObservationKeys → policy_observation_keys, and 13 other systematic transformations
  - **Documentation Enhancement**: Added comprehensive "Configuration Key Naming Conventions" section to guide-configuration-system.md explaining casing rules, rationale, and CLI impact
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy with clean break (no backward compatibility), preserved CLI usability for frequently-used sections, respected component boundaries
  - **Testing Verified**: Both BaseTask and BlindGrasping task loading and training pipeline work correctly with new snake_case keys
  - **Impact**: Improved code consistency between configuration files and Python code while maintaining CLI usability for frequently-overridden keys
  - Comprehensive configuration refactoring with systematic snake_case transformation and thorough testing validation
- ✅ **refactor-007-step-architecture.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Investigate step processing architecture consistency
  - **Root Cause**: Question about architectural inconsistency - why pre_physics_step is in DexHandBase but post_physics_step delegates to StepProcessor component
  - **Architecture Analysis**: Comprehensive investigation revealed 3:1 complexity ratio (120+ lines vs 40 lines) justifies different architectural treatments
  - **Expert Consensus**: Multi-expert analysis confirmed current design as optimal - complexity-justified separation aligns with single responsibility principle
  - **Design Decision**: Keep current split architecture - simple pre_physics action processing in DexHandBase, complex post_physics orchestration in StepProcessor
  - **Documentation Added**: Added architectural rationale comments to both components explaining design decision and complexity justification

  - **Core Implementation Changes**: Renamed task file (box_grasping_task.py → blind_grasping_task.py), updated class (BoxGraspingTask → BlindGraspingTask), renamed config (BoxGrasping.yaml → BlindGrasping.yaml), updated factory registration
  - **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive update across 31 files including all task references (BoxGrasping → BlindGrasping), CLI commands (task=BoxGrasping → task=BlindGrasping), and file references throughout docs/, prompts/, README, TRAINING guides
  - **Test Script Fix**: Fixed test script to use cfg.task.name instead of hardcoded "BaseTask" for proper task loading
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Followed fail-fast philosophy (no backward compatibility), pure refactoring with zero behavioral changes, maintained existing task architecture patterns
  - **Testing Verified**: Both control modes work (position and position_delta), training pipeline functions correctly, test script properly loads BlindGrasping task
  - **Impact**: Improved task naming accuracy with comprehensive rename across 31 files while maintaining identical functionality
  - Pure refactoring task with systematic renaming and comprehensive documentation updates
- ✅ **refactor-003-imports.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Clean up mid-file imports for opencv and flask
  - **Root Cause**: Mid-file imports with conditional checking violated fail-fast philosophy and created unnecessary defensive programming patterns
  - **Dependencies Made Required**: Moved opencv-python>=4.5.0 and flask>=2.0.0 from extras_require to INSTALL_REQUIRES in setup.py for consistent availability
  - **Import Cleanup**: Added cv2 and flask imports to top of train.py, removed 35+ lines of conditional import checking and dependency validation logic

- ✅ **refactor-004-render.md** (2025-07-30) - **MEDIUM** - Clarify render option semantics (viewer vs background rendering)
  - **Root Cause**: Legacy render configuration was ambiguous and violated single source of truth principles with assumption-based logic
  - **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed deprecated `recordVideo: false` from config.yaml root level, eliminated all legacy video option references
  - **Consistent Structure**: Added explicit viewer/videoRecord/videoStream defaults to BaseTask.yaml, migrated all test config files to new structure
  - **CLI Enhancement**: Added `viewer=true` CLI alias mapping to `env.viewer=true` for improved usability in train.py
  - **Legacy Removal**: Cleaned up recordVideo handling in examples/dexhand_test.py, updated train.py log messages, fixed documentation examples
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Eliminated assumption-based rendering logic, all decisions now come from explicit configuration (no code defaults)
  - **Impact**: Clear render semantics with independent control of interactive visualization, video recording, and video streaming
  - **Documentation Updates** (2025-07-30): Completed legacy option removal - updated all documentation files (TRAINING.md, guide-http-video-streaming.md, guide-configuration-system.md, README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, guide-physics-tuning.md) to use new configuration names (viewer/videoRecord/videoStream instead of render/recordVideo/streamVideo)
  - Comprehensive cleanup across 23 files with improved configuration clarity and removed technical debt
- ✅ **fix-005-box-bounce-physics.md** (2025-07-29) - **ESSENTIAL** - Fix box bouncing at initialization in BlindGrasping task
  - **Root Cause**: Refactor-005-default-values changed VecTask substeps from hardcoded default 2 to explicit config value 4, making physics simulation more accurate and exposing box positioning precision issues
  - **Physics Analysis**: Higher substeps (4 vs 2) = more accurate collision detection, revealing that box center at z=0.025m placed bottom exactly at z=0 with no clearance for collision sensitivity
  - **Principled Solution**: Adjusted box initial z position from 0.025m to 0.027m (box half-size + 2mm clearance) to work with accurate physics rather than masking the issue
  - **Configuration Fix**: Updated BlindGrasping.yaml with clear comment explaining the clearance requirement for accurate physics simulation

  - **Critical Fix**: Fixed training pipeline config access pattern (cfg.train["seed"] → cfg["train"]["seed"]) for dict vs OmegaConf compatibility
  - **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed all hardcoded defaults from ActionProcessor, VideoManager, ViewerController, ObservationEncoder, TerminationManager, VecTask, and DexHandBase
  - **Config Transparency**: Added explicit clipObservations/clipActions to config.yaml, termination rewards to BaseTask.yaml
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Eliminated defensive programming while preserving legitimate external interface defaults
  - **Testing Verified**: Both test script and training pipeline (BaseTask/BlindGrasping) work correctly
  - **Impact**: Restored training pipeline, improved fail-fast behavior, made all parameters discoverable in config files

## Strategic Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (Current Priority)
With refactor-001-episode-length.md completed, focus shifts to next high priority architectural tasks.

### Phase 2: System Stability (Short-term)
1. **fix-002-consistency.md** - Fix consistency issues
2. **fix-003-max-iterations.md** - Config override fixes and train.py cleanup
3. **refactor-005-default-values.md** - Move hardcoded defaults to config
4. **refactor-008-config-key-casing.md** - Unify config key naming conventions

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Medium-term)
5. **refactor-004-render.md** - Render option semantics clarification
6. **refactor-003-imports.md** - Clean up mid-file imports
7. **refactor-007-blind-grasping.md** - Rename BoxGrasping to BlindGrasping task
8. **refactor-007-step-architecture.md** - Investigate step processing architecture consistency
9. **feat-***: Feature enhancements (streaming, video, testing modes)
10. **doc-***: Documentation improvements and illustrations

### Task Complexity Assessment
- **High complexity**: refactor-007-step-architecture (architecture investigation)
- **Medium complexity**: fix-003 (maxIterations config override), fix-002 (consistency issues)
- **Low complexity**: Most feat-* tasks, config cleanups, import organization, doc-* tasks
