# Development Roadmap for DexRobot Isaac

## ðŸŸ¡ Current Issues

### 1. Contact Force Verification (Issue #4)
- **Status**: âœ… INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - System working correctly
- **Problem**: Contact forces showing as zeros despite visual contact
- **Root Cause**: Contact forces are detected correctly but on hand base/palm (rigid body indices 9,11,17,19) rather than fingertips (indices 14,20,26,32,38)
- **Key Findings**:
  - âœ… TensorManager.refresh_tensors() successfully detects contact forces up to 1211N magnitude
  - âœ… Contact force tensor and indexing system working correctly
  - âœ… Debug logging confirmed contact forces are detected at non-fingertip rigid bodies
- **Next Steps**: Verify fingertip collision geometry in MJCF model or adjust test scene for fingertip contact
- **Impact**: Contact force system is functional - just need proper contact setup

### 2. Episode Length Parameter Not Working
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: The `--episode-length` parameter in test script does not properly limit episode duration
- **Root Cause**: `reset_buf` was not cleared after resetting environments, causing continuous resets
- **Fix**: Added `self.reset_buf[env_ids] = 0` in `reset_manager.reset_idx()` following Isaac Gym standard
- **Documentation**: Created `docs/guide-environment-resets.md` explaining the reset system
- **Verified**: Episodes now properly reset at configured length without continuous resets

### 3. th_rot_target Decreases Instead of Increasing
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
- **Problem**: With `--policy-controls-fingers=true`, th_rot_target decreases from step 20 to 25 in test script
- **Expected**: Should increase linearly during this period
- **Location**: Likely in action_processor.py finger coupling logic or test script action generation
- **Impact**: Incorrect thumb rotation control
- **Steps to reproduce**: Run `python examples/dexhand_test.py --policy-controls-fingers=true` and observe th_rot_target values

### 4. Multi-Environment Testing
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
- **Problem**: Need to verify system works correctly with num_envs > 1
- **Tasks**:
  - Test with various num_envs (2, 4, 16, 64)
  - Verify reset_idx works correctly with different environment indices
  - Check performance scaling with multiple environments
  - Ensure observations/actions are properly batched

## ðŸŸ¢ Future Development

### Phase 2 - Architecture & Quality

  - âœ… Fixed num_actions fail-fast property access
  - âœ… Verified environment creation, reset, and step work correctly
  - âœ… Basic PPO training loop tested successfully
- [x] Implement modular reward system (reaching, grasping, manipulation components)
  - âœ… BaseTaskRewards with weighted components (alive, height_safety, finger_velocity)
  - âœ… Clean separation between reward computation and termination logic
- [x] Add reward visualization/debugging tools
  - âœ… TensorBoard integration with comprehensive reward component logging
  - âœ… RewardComponentObserver tracks episode totals and per-step averages
  - âœ… Hierarchical organization by termination type and weight type
- [ ] **Box Grasping Task** (Priority: High)
  - Environment setup:
    - Single 5cm box at origin with slight position randomization
    - 10-second episode timeout (failure)
  - Observations:
    - All base observations except exact contact forces
    - Binary contact indicators (touch/no-touch) per finger instead of force magnitudes
  - Rewards:
    - Standard base rewards (alive, height_safety, finger_velocity)
    - Additional: object height reward component
  - Termination criteria:
    - Success: object height > 20cm AND â‰¥2 fingers in contact for â‰¥2 seconds
    - Failure: any fingertip/pad or hand base z â‰¤ 0
    - Timeout: 10 seconds
  - **Implementation Plan**:
    - **Phase 1: Base Framework Enhancements** âœ… COMPLETED
      - âœ… Add binary contact observation to ObservationEncoder
        - New observation type: "contact_binary" with configurable threshold
        - Reduces sim2real gap by abstracting force magnitudes
        - BaseTask now uses binary contacts instead of exact forces
      - âœ… Add contact duration tracking as observer state
        - Track per-body contact durations indexed by contactForceBodies
        - Vectorized duration updates with transition detection
        - Query interface: get_contact_duration_by_body(body_name)
        - Integrated reset handling for proper state management
    - **Phase 2: BoxGraspingTask Implementation**
      - Create BoxGraspingTask class implementing DexTask interface
      - Box asset loading and per-environment actor creation
      - Box state tracking and observations (pose, velocities)
      - Object height reward computation
      - Success/failure criteria using ContactDurationTracker
      - Box reset with position randomization
    - **Phase 3: Configuration and Testing**
      - Create BoxGrasping.yaml configuration
      - Set episodeLength: 2000 (10 seconds at 200Hz)
      - Configure box physics (mass: 0.1kg, friction: 1.0)
      - Tune reward weights for stable grasping behavior
      - Test success/failure detection and contact tracking
- [ ] Create training scripts with DexHand-specific hyperparameters
- [ ] Benchmark learning performance

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- [ ] **Domain Randomization Framework** (Phased Approach)

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Order
1. Fix bugs (th_rot_target issue)
2. Complete architecture documentation
3. Implement core RL features
4. Add advanced capabilities
5. Optimize performance

### Development Principles
- Maintain fail-fast behavior - no defensive programming for internal logic
- Follow scientific computing mindset with vectorization
- Keep single source of truth for all shared state
- Use proper logging levels throughout
- Test changes with `python examples/dexhand_test.py` before committing
- Write clear documentation for new features

## ðŸ”´ Won't Fix

### CPU Pipeline Multi-Environment DOF Control Issue
- **Problem**: In CPU pipeline, `gym.set_dof_position_target_tensor()` only applies to environment 0
- **Evidence**: GPU works correctly, CPU ignores environments 1+ (contradicts Isaac Gym documentation)
- **Workaround**: Use GPU pipeline for multi-environment simulations
- **Decision**: Won't fix - Isaac Gym limitation, use GPU pipeline instead
