Support more manipulation tasks.

Source includes:
- IsaacGymEnvs examples of manipulation task of other hands
- RoboHive environments

Need to define a set of tasks and do tuning on a per-task basis. Can refer to the observations / actions / rewards / reset logic of existing IsaacGymEnvs tasks. Need to write PRD(s) for each new task.
