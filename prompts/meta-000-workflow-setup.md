Keep todo items in @prompts/

Create a ROADMAP.md file to organize the items.

Prefix specific todo items with refactor_, feat_, fix_, or rl_. Specifically, task-specific design / tuning and RL physics tunings should fall in the `rl_` category (which is more research-oriented than traditional software engineering).

Update CLAUDE.md to tell AI to use the guideline.

Fix one item in a session. Work in the following order:
- Ultrathink to obtain context about the issue and expand the todo item markdown into a PRD / architecture document.
- Come up with detailed implementation plan and request user's approval.
- Implement the plan and request user's review.
