# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands
- Install: `pip install -e .`
- Run simple test: `python examples/dexhand_test.py`
- Run with options: `python examples/dexhand_test.py --episode-length 200 --debug --movement-speed 0.5`
- Test different control modes: `python examples/dexhand_test.py --control-mode position_delta --policy-controls-fingers true --policy-controls-base false`

## Development Philosophy

### Fail Fast - No Defensive Programming
This is research code where exposing bugs immediately is critical. NEVER hide errors with fallbacks.

‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
```python
if x is None: x = default_value  # NO!
try: ... except: use_fallback   # NO!
value = x if x else fallback     # NO!
if hasattr(obj, 'attr'): ...     # NO! Let AttributeError expose bugs
```

‚úÖ REQUIRED:
```python
if x is None:
    raise RuntimeError("x is None - this indicates initialization bug")
# Let code crash immediately to expose problems at their source
```

### Think Like a Scientist
Write elegant mathematical code, not defensive business logic.

**Defensive Programming Clarification:**
- ‚úÖ DO check for external failures (hardware, file I/O, network)
- ‚ùå DON'T check if your own dependencies are None
- ‚ùå DON'T add fallbacks for your own logic errors
- If a dependency is required at init, it should NEVER be None later

‚ùå WRONG - Business programmer mindset:
```python
if self.policy_controls_hand_base:
    if self.actions.shape[1] > 0:
        base_actions = self.actions[:, :self.NUM_BASE_DOFS]
        # ... 20 more lines of branching
```

‚úÖ CORRECT - Scientific computing mindset:
```python
# Use masks and vectorization
scaled_actions[:, self.active_target_mask] = self._scale_actions_to_limits(actions)
```

**Key Principles:**
1. **Masking > Branching**: Boolean masks replace conditional logic
2. **Precompute Everything**: Runtime should be pure math
3. **Vectorize Operations**: Think in tensors, not loops
4. **Function Pointers**: Assign functions during init, not runtime branching

### Fail-Fast for Required Dependencies
When a component requires something to function, NEVER check if it exists before using it. This was the root cause of the viewer camera not focusing on startup.

‚ùå WRONG - Defensive check that silently fails:
```python
# Update camera position if following robot
if self.viewer_controller:
    if self.hand_rigid_body_indices:  # Silent failure if None!
        hand_positions = self.rigid_body_states[env_indices, self.hand_rigid_body_indices, :3]
        self.viewer_controller.update_camera_position(hand_positions)
```

‚úÖ CORRECT - Fail fast if required dependency is missing:
```python
# Camera MUST follow robot - fail if indices not initialized
if self.hand_rigid_body_index is None:
    raise RuntimeError("hand_rigid_body_index is None - initialization failed")
hand_positions = self.rigid_body_states[:, self.hand_rigid_body_index, :3]
self.viewer_controller.update_camera_position(hand_positions)
```

Key principle: If something is required for correct operation, it should NEVER be None after initialization. Don't check - just use it and let it fail fast if there's a bug.

## Critical Design Caveats

### Fixed Base with Relative Motion
- Hand uses `fix_base_link = True` - won't fall under gravity
- **ALL motion is relative to spawn position**:
  - `ARTz = 0.0` ‚Üí stay at spawn height
  - `ARTz = +0.1` ‚Üí move 0.1m UP from spawn
  - NOT absolute world coordinates!

### Floating Hand Coordinate Quirk
- Model has built-in 90¬∞ Y-axis rotation
- When ARRx=ARRy=ARRz=0, quaternion is [0, 0.707, 0, 0.707] not [0, 0, 0, 1]
- Use `hand_pose_arr_aligned` observation for ARR-aligned orientation

### Isaac Gym Requirements
- Joint limits MUST have `limited="true"` in MJCF
- GPU pipeline needs specific call order: create actors ‚Üí acquire tensors ‚Üí `prepare_sim()`
- Properties come from MJCF files - no code overrides

## Code Style
- Imports: Standard library ‚Üí third-party ‚Üí local
- Use loguru logger, not print statements
- Include shape assertions for new tensors
- Prefer vectorized operations over loops
- Use type hints where possible

## Component Architecture

### Two-Phase Initialization
Many components require two-phase init due to control_dt dependency:
```python
# Phase 1: Basic setup
action_processor = ActionProcessor(...)
action_processor.initialize_from_config(config)

# Phase 2: After physics manager ready
action_processor.finalize_setup()  # Now control_dt available
```

### Single Source of Truth
- `control_dt` lives only in PhysicsManager
- Components access via property decorators
- No manual synchronization needed

## Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Component-based architecture refactor
- GPU pipeline support
- DOF control and action mapping
- Position and position_delta modes
- Rule-based control for partial policy control
- Observation system with dict/tensor separation
- Rerun visualization integration (16 plots in examples/dexhand_test.py)
- Euler angle conversion for debugging
- PPO training integration with rl_games (tested at ~1000 fps)
- **TerminationManager refactor**: Clean separation of termination decisions vs reset execution
- **TensorBoard logging**: Episodes terminate correctly and rewards are logged properly

### üîß Current Issues
- **Contact Force Verification** (Issue #4): Need objects in scene to verify contact observations work

### üìã TODO
- **Phase 2 - Architecture & Quality**:
  - Clean up excessive debug logging
  - Implement proper logging levels (debug, info, warning, error)
  - Standardize naming (dex_hand vs dexhand)
  - Update README files with current architecture

- **Phase 3 - RL Integration**:
  - Implement reward system
  - Add reward visualization/debugging tools
  - Create training scripts with hyperparameter configs for different tasks
  - Benchmark learning performance
  - Add SAC algorithm support

- **Phase 3 - Advanced Features**:
  - ROS2 interface for real robot deployment
  - Record/playback functionality for demonstrations
  - Performance profiling and optimization
  - Add more task environments beyond BaseTask
